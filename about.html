								<p class="lead-p">Kaddosh is a contemporary Parisian bistro showcasing techniques rooted in Uganda but influenced by our regionality, carefully sourcing only the best ingredients from both the mid atlantic & abroad. Building off the vibrant food scene of kampala's Neo-bistro movement, Kaddosh displays an inspiring take on Ugandan cuisine in a relaxing environment.  This enables our genuine approach to food & hospitality to shine.

we opened our doors at a very small area storefront with a very big idea. Instead of fast food, we’d serve fast fuel: shakes that were delicious, nutritious, and protein-packed.</p>
								<p class="lead-p">
 It was a success from the start but quickly became something even bigger... a game changer. We saw what was happening and got excited. Let’s keep going. So we discovered quinoa and expanded the menu to serve a full selection of high-protein salads, wraps, and bowls customizable for all diets. Every body loved it. The all-day power of protein grew in popularity. We all started eating, feeling and moving better. It’s all good..</p>

				<p class="lead-p">
Our attentive staff ensures that your entire dining experience at kaddosh is stellar from beginning to end. Each passing of our shared plates and the breaking of fresh Levantine pita opens up a new conversation.</p>
<p class="lead-p">
Whether part of a party of fifty or a party of two, your experience throughout our elegant, yet comfortable space is eventful. We are sharing our long held Lebanese-Mediterranean traditions with a modern contemporary twist. You will feel both close to home and apart of something new.</p>
